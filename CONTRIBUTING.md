# Contributing Guidelines

Dear fellow simulationist,

Moire is generally not intended for mass use, its main purpose is to
give a solid GUI for [Xentica](https://github.com/a5kin/xentica/)
framework. That's why it is so important for us to know if someone
uses it for other goals. If you'd like to use Moire as GUI for your
own simulations (or already using it), please just let us know what's
on your mind. How do you use it, what do you think of it, and how it
could be improved to suit better for your liking. That's the only way
you can contribute to the project right now.

The easier way to give us feedback is by
[open an issue](https://github.com/a5kin/moire/issues/new)
at GitHub. When doing so, please follow the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/a5kin/moire/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
we are abiding. In general, just be benevolent and respect others. And
stay super-creative as you are.

With generative blessings,\
Xentica / Moire Team
